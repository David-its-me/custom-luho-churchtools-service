### Compile Protocol Buffers

ProPresenter uses Google Protocol Buffers to write and read .pro files. [ProPresenter7-Proto
](https://github.com/greyshirtguy/ProPresenter7-Proto) is a GitHub Repository, which offers the reverse engineered .proto definitions. We use them here in this project to write .pro files for ProPresenter on our own.

Actually it is only necessary to compile Protocol Buffers only once. For the sake of completeness here is a short description on all the required steps. 

To compile the python code from the protocol buffers you need protocol buffers installed on your system. You can download the executables from the [downloads page](https://protobuf.dev/downloads/).

Add the protoc.exe to your system PATH so that you will be able to execute ```protoc``` from everywhere in your system in the command line.

The autogenerated files from Protocol Buffers are intended to go into the ```src/propresenter/pb_auto_generated``` folder of this project.  

From the project root folder, this command may work for you to compile Protocol Buffers, if you have the [ProPresenter7-Proto
](https://github.com/greyshirtguy/ProPresenter7-Proto) repository cloned right next to this repo in your file system.

In order to auto generated everything properly for this project run the ```protocol_buffers_utils/generate_protobuf.py``` python script.
